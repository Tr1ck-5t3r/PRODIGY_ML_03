# Prodigy Infotech Task 3

## Task Description

Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 12,000 images of cats and dogs. The images are grayscale and have a size of 150x150 pixels. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set contains 6,000 images, while the test set contains 3,000 images, and the validation set contains 3,000 images.

## Deliverables

- A jupyter notebook containing the code for the ector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs.
- Repository containing the dataset where the pictures are stored in the following, file structure:

```
dataset/
    train/
        cats/
            cat.1.jpg
            cat.2.jpg
            ...
        dogs/
            dog.1.jpg
            dog.2.jpg
            ...
    test/
        cats/
            cat.1.jpg
            cat.2.jpg
            ...
        dogs/
            dog.1.jpg
            dog.2.jpg
            ...
    val/
        cats/
            cat.1.jpg
            cat.2.jpg
            ...
        dogs/
            dog.1.jpg
            dog.2.jpg
            ...
```

## Results and Discussion

The SVM model was able to classify images of cats and dogs with an accuracy of 0.98. The model was trained on a dataset containing 6,000 images of cats and dogs and tested on a dataset containing 3,000 images of cats and dogs. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.97 on the test set.

```
Test Accuracy: 0.977
Test Precision: 0.9770
```

## Conclusion

The SVM model was able to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. The model can be used to classify images of cats and dogs in real-world applications.
